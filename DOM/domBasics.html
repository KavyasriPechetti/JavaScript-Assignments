        <p>Data types like number and string can store only one value at a time. So, to store more than one value at a time, we have arrays and objects in JavaScript. As we already know, arrays have numbered indexes starting from 0. But in objects, data is stored as key-value pairs.</p>

        <p>These key-value pairs are known as properties. An object is very similar to an array but with the difference that you define the keys yourself. You're not limited to using only numeric indexes but can use friendlier keys, such as first_name, age, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>When talking about arrays, you say that they contain elements. When talking about objects, you say that they contain properties. A property of an object can contain a function, because functions are just data. In this case, you say that this property is a method.</p>

        <p>There are two ways to access a property of an object.Using square bracket notation, for example: hero['occupation'].Using the dot notation, for example: hero.occupation</p>
